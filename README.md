## Installation Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/amerthesavage/AI-Resume-Builder-and-Analyzer.git
    cd AI-Resume-Builder-and-Analyzer
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    * If you are facing issues related to `nltk`, make sure to install it separately with `pip install nltk` and download required resources with `nltk.download('punkt')` and `nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')` in your python environment
4.  **Database initialization:**

    *   The application uses an SQLite database (`resume_data.db`) to store resume data, analysis results, and admin logs.  The database is initialized automatically when the application starts through the `init_database()` function in `config/database.py`. No manual initialization is typically required.

## Usage Guide

1.  **Run the Streamlit application:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
